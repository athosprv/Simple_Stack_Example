<h1>Simple Stack example.</h1>
<h2><u>Input:</u></h2>
<p>The input for each test consists of a single number indicating the number of 
lines of text that follow in the problem, followed by that many lines of text.</p>
<h2><u>Output:</u></h2>
<p>Your output for each test should consist of all the lines of text given to 
you as input (ignoring the initial number) but returned in reverse order.&nbsp; 
You should then send a blank line to indicate the end of your output.</p>
<h2><u>End of Input:</u></h2>
<p>The end of input will be signaled by a test that has 0 lines.&nbsp; This will 
look like a line with a 0 on it by itself.&nbsp; Once you read the 0, you should 
simply return control to the caller of your run method (i.e. simply return from 
your run&nbsp; method).</p>
<h2><u>Example:</u></h2>
<p>Below is a sample input and the corresponding output.</p>
<p><u>input:<br>
</u>3<br>
red<br>
white<br>
blue<br>
1<br>
hello<br>
0</p>
<p><u>output:<br>
</u>blue<br>
white<br>
red<br>
<br>
hello<br>
&nbsp;</p>
