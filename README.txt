Simple Stack example.

Input:

The input for each test consists of a single number indicating the number of lines of text that follow in the problem, followed by that many lines of text.

Output:

Your output for each test should consist of all the lines of text given to you as input (ignoring the initial number) but returned in reverse order.  You should then send a blank line to indicate the end of your output.

End of Input:

The end of input will be signaled by a test that has 0 lines.  This will look like a line with a 0 on it by itself.  Once you read the 0, you should simply return control to the caller of your run method (i.e. simply return from your run  method).

Example:

Below is a sample input and the corresponding output.

input:
3
red
white
blue
1
hello
0

output:
blue
white
red

hello
